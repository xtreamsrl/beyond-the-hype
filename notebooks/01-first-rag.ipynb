    "You are asked to write a chatbot to help users with choosing a movie to watch. It's a simple task, after all. You know that LLMs can store factual informations, but to have more reliable answers and up-to-date information, you choose to implement a pattern named Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The term was coined in a famous paper from 2020 [(arXiv:2005.11401)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) - at the time, ChatGPT wasn't even released, though we already had models like GPT-3 ([arXiv:2005.14165](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)) to play around with. (GPT-3 weights weren't, and still aren't, released.)\n",
